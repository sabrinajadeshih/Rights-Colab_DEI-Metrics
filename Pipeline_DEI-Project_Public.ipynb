            Inclusivity should be a top priority for HR, but it can be hard to implement Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategies and turn them into real action to achieve true inclusivity. Keeping track of goals and assessing DEI throughout the year can help you stay on track and find out how inclusive your company really is.\\n\\nWhat is true inclusivity?\\nTrue inclusivity means going beyond an on-paper DEI strategy to actively implement inclusivity into your workplace, for people across all points of difference such as ability, race, gender and religion. True inclusivity goes beyond just HR initiatives, too – it needs to be a company-wide culture of openness and belonging for all.\\n\\nAlthough it may seem hard to achieve, inclusivity is an important part of DEI that can even help the business. Inclusivity can lead to more innovation and may be more likely to outperform competitors. This is because creating a culture of inclusivity makes all employees feel welcomed. It gives them a sense of belonging, which can not only increase meaningfulness at work but can make them feel more comfortable bringing ideas to the table. \\n\\nHow to create true inclusivity\\nWhen it comes to promoting equity and inclusion, there are three areas to focus on, says Aubrey Blanche, global head of equitable design and impact at Culture Amp. \\n\\nBlanche suggests focusing efforts on creating transparency in talent processes, intentionally prioritizing fairness and promoting access to development and recognition. This may look like: \\n\\nImplementing employee recognition programs\\nHaving formal mentorship and sponsorship programs\\nCreating clear career advancement processes, and\\nExplicitly sourcing underrepresented talent.\\nHow to track and assess inclusivity \\nConstantly assessing and keeping track of DEI goals can help you understand what you’re doing well and what still needs to be worked on to create true inclusivity. ...   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ... Japan\\nSo if workplace weight loss programs don’t actually improve employee health — what is it they are attempting to do?\\n\\nAs the writer and fat activist Aubrey Gordon put it when discussing workplace wellness programs on a recent episode of her podcast \"Maintenance Phase\": \"One of the major narratives that drives our understanding of and response to fat people in the world: Fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" And it’s true. Many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. But that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. According to a UCLA study published in 2016, misusing BMI as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat Americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. And yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like BMI and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nThere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. The same \"Maintenance Phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" Another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" And one more for good measure: “There is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for The American Journal of Managed Care. To help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: Are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? They should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. As they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. Office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. Hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. Health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. Weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. And any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...   \n","2  Layoffs Challenged Based on Gender\\n\\nSoon after Elon Musk bought Twitter, the company laid off about 3,700 employees—roughly half its workforce—and hundreds more then resigned. The new lawsuit said that Twitter laid off 57 percent of its female employees, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender disparity was greater for engineering roles, where 63 percent of women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n\"It's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when Elon Musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,\" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, the plaintiffs' lawyer, who is in Boston.\\n\\nTwitter has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit involving the alleged failure to provide advance notice and hasn't responded to other complaints.\\n\\n(The Guardian)\\n\\nOther Complaints\\n\\nOther complaints against Twitter claim it backed out of promises to allow remote work and provide consistent severance benefits after Musk bought the company, as well as complaints related to alleged disability- and gender-based discrimination and another lawsuit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off. At least one employee claimed that Twitter did not provide enough notice of the layoffs, allegedly violating federal and California laws, and did not offer additional pay in lieu of notice. Three claims also have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.\\n\\nTwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.\\n\\n(CNN)\\n\\nLayoffs Snowball\\n\\nTwitter isn't the only company that has laid off workers. The technology sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands laid off, including from Meta and Stripe. Sales and recruiting jobs have sustained some of the deepest cuts. In addition, layoffs have spread beyond technology, such as to the Walt Disney Co.\\n\\n(SHRM Online and Fast Company)\\n\\nLayoffs Are Harming DE&I Efforts\\n\\nRecent layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, have eroded diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts nationwide. The tech industry already is one of the least diverse. In 2021, just 4.4 percent of employees at Google were Black and 6.4 percent were Latino, according to the company's diversity report. At Meta, people with disabilities represented about 6 percent of the company's workforce, despite accounting for 19 percent of the U.S. labor force.\\n\\n(SHRM Online)\\n\\nHow to Conduct Layoffs the Right Way\\n\\nIn addition to abiding by employment laws regarding layoffs, communication and accurate information are two of the most essential elements to conducting layoffs well. It's important to ensure everyone is aware of what's happening and what their options are.\\n\\n\"Folks impacted by job loss have so many questions, are often fraught with fear and trepidation of what's next, and they need and deserve support,\" said Barbie Winterbottom, CHRO, founder and CEO of the Business of HR in Tampa, Fla. \"At the same time, HR teams can be overwhelmed with phone calls and e-mails from hundreds or thousands of employees while trying to process required documents and manage required steps in systems. It can make timely communication tough.\"\\n\\n(SHRM Online)   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, is a popular yet sensitive topic in the workforce today. Leadership and HR that recognize this are finding ways to ensure employees from all races, ethnicities, abilities, sexual orientations, religions, etc., are represented. Sometimes included, but often left out, is age.\\n\\nAge shows no color, race, religion, sex, etc. It just is. People get older, and as they do, workplace biases may become evident. It’s important to be aware of this issue. A 2022 study by LiveCareer, Older People & the Workplace, revealed some intriguing findings regarding age-related stereotypes and discrimination. More than 1,000 workers were surveyed to “investigate their opinions about older people in the workplace.”\\n\\nEight in ten respondents claimed age stereotypes were still alive in the workplace.\\nWhat is considered old? Forty-three percent of those surveyed said 40-plus is old. Twenty-six percent said 50-plus is old. And 21% said 60-plus is old. So, if you are 50, with probably 15 or more years until retirement, 69% of the people you work with think you are old. Here are some more findings from LiveCareer’s study to get you thinking about how your organization treats aging employees:\\n\\n· 74% of the respondents aged 50-plus said they had been fired because of their age.\\n\\n\\n· 86% aged 50-plus felt that most job postings were addressed to people younger than them.\\n\\n· 72% of respondents claimed that older employees were a target for workplace bullying. · 77% of the respondents said: I haven’t been hired for a job because of my age.\\n\\n· 69% said: I’m afraid to lose my job because of my age.\\n\\nIf over 50 is old, then leadership is … old. According to Zippia, there are over 38,700 CEOs currently employed in the U.S., and their average age is 52 years old. If you look at the Fortune 500, the average age of a CEO is 57. Several companies on the Fortune list are run by CEOs ranging from 71 to 91! Consider the age of the most powerful executives in the United States. President Biden was 78 when he became president. Donald Trump was 70. Barak Obama seems like a baby considering he entered the Oval Office when he was just 47. The overall average age of a United States president entering office is 56 (almost 57).\\n...   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Summary.   \\nMany factors contribute to a substantial gender pay gap in the U.S. But what about environments in which compensation structures are seemingly completely objective and bias-free? The authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the MBTA at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. They identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules. Since women tend to have more inflexible commitments outside of work (such as elder care and childcare), they generally end up taking home less pay when shifts are scheduled last-minute, at non-standard hours, or via a system that doesn’t give workers control over their assignments. Moreover, the authors found that these scheduling practices ended up harming the MBTA’s performance metrics as well, leading to more canceled bus and train routes. To address these issues, the authors recommend that employers should endeavor to offer more-predictable schedules and build in redundancies so that workers aren’t asked to work last-minute or at unconventional times. Despite substantial progress toward pay equity, women in 2022 still earn 17% less than men on average. Many explanations for this gap have been proposed: Women may choose to work in lower-paying occupations; they may have less experience due to having taken time off to have kids or care for elders; they may shy away from negotiation or competition; they may be passed over by managers, perhaps due to conscious or unconscious bias. But what would happen to the earnings gap if we eliminated all of these factors?...   \n","\n","

priority for hr, but it can be hard to implement diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) strategies and turn them into real action to achieve true inclusivity. keeping track of goals and assessing dei throughout the year can help you stay on track and find out how inclusive your company really is.\\n\\nwhat is true inclusivity?\\ntrue inclusivity means going beyond an on-paper dei strategy to actively implement inclusivity into your workplace, for people across all points of difference such as ability, race, gender and religion. true inclusivity goes beyond just hr initiatives, too – it needs to be a company-wide culture of openness and belonging for all.\\n\\nalthough it may seem hard to achieve, inclusivity is an important part of dei that can even help the business. inclusivity can lead to more innovation and may be more likely to outperform competitors. this is because creating a culture of inclusivity makes all employees feel welcomed. it gives them a sense of belonging, which can not only increase meaningfulness at work but can make them feel more comfortable bringing ideas to the table. \\n\\nhow to create true inclusivity\\nwhen it comes to promoting equity and inclusion, there are three areas to focus on, says aubrey blanche, global head of equitable design and impact at culture amp. \\n\\nblanche suggests focusing efforts on creating transparency in talent processes, intentionally prioritizing fairness and promoting access to development and recognition. this may look like: \\n\\nimplementing employee recognition programs\\nhaving formal mentorship and sponsorship programs\\ncreating clear career advancement processes, and\\nexplicitly sourcing underrepresented talent.\\nhow to track and assess inclusivity \\nconstantly assessing and keeping track of dei goals can help you understand what you’re doing well and what still needs to be worked on to create true inclusivity. ...   \n","1

actually improve employee health — what is it they are attempting to do?\\n\\nas the writer and fat activist aubrey gordon put it when discussing workplace wellness programs on a recent episode of her podcast \"maintenance phase\": \"one of the major narratives that drives our understanding of and response to fat people in the world: fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" and it’s true. many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. but that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. according to a ucla study published in 2016, misusing bmi as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. and yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like bmi and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nthere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. the same \"maintenance phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" and one more for good measure: “there is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for the american journal of managed care. to help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? they should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. as they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. and any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...   \n","2  twitter’s layoffs allegedly

women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n\"it's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when elon musk was

evident. it’s important to be aware of this issue. a 2022 study by livecareer, older people & the workplace, revealed some intriguing findings regarding age-related stereotypes and discrimination. more than 1,000 workers were surveyed to “investigate their opinions about older people in the workplace.”\\n\\neight in ten respondents claimed age stereotypes were still alive in the workplace.\\nwhat is considered old? forty-three percent of those surveyed said 40-plus is old. twenty-six percent said 50-plus is old. and 21% said 60-plus is old. so, if you are 50, with probably 15

employees:\\n\\n· 74% of the respondents aged 50-plus said they had been fired because of their age.\\n\\n\\n· 86% aged 50-plus felt that most job postings were addressed to people younger than

what about environments in which compensation structures are seemingly completely objective and bias-free? the authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the mbta at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. they identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules. since women tend to have more inflexible commitments outside of work (such as elder care and childcare), they generally end up taking home less pay when shifts are scheduled last-minute, at non-standard hours, or via a system that doesn’t give workers control over their assignments. moreover, the authors found that these scheduling practices ended up harming the mbta’s performance metrics as well, leading to more canceled bus and train routes. to address these issues, the authors recommend that employers should endeavor to offer more-predictable schedules and build in redundancies so that workers aren’t asked to work last-minute or at unconventional times. despite substantial progress toward pay equity, women in 2022 still earn 17% less than men on average. many explanations for this gap have been proposed: women may choose to work in lower-paying occupations; they may have less experience due to having taken time off to have kids or care for elders; they may shy away from negotiation or competition; they may be passed over by managers, perhaps due to conscious or unconscious bias. but what would happen to the earnings gap if we eliminated all of these factors?...   \n","\n","   ANY_RRP_TOPIC  ANY_WVP_TOPIC  ANY_DEISG_TOPIC  ANY_MBOD_TOPIC  \\\n","0              0

Japan\\nSo if workplace weight loss programs don’t actually improve employee health — what is it they are attempting to do?\\n\\nAs the writer and fat activist Aubrey Gordon put it when discussing workplace wellness programs on a recent episode of her podcast \"Maintenance Phase\": \"One of the major narratives that drives our understanding of and response to fat people in the world: Fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" And it’s true. Many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. But that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. According to a UCLA study published in 2016, misusing BMI as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat Americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. And yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like BMI and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nThere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. The same \"Maintenance Phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" Another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" And one more for good measure: “There is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for The American Journal of Managed Care. To help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: Are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? They should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. As they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. Office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. Hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. Health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. Weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. And any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...</td>\n","      <td>https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/leave-2023-weight-loss-talk-out-of-work-fat-employers-dei-rcna64069</td>\n","      <td>training-bias/anti-harassment/non-discrimination (Worker-Voice/Protection): [(' train', '(anti|non)?( |-)bias', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\ncombat bias (General-Practice): [('combat', ' bias', ' bias'), [6, 15], 0]\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>harassment (DEI-Strategy/Governance): [('harass', 'harass', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\ndiscrimination (DEI-Strategy/Governance): [(' discriminat', ' discriminat', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\nharassment-employee (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('harass', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', ' bias'), [10, 15], -1]\\n\\ninclusive culture (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('work( )?place', 'work', '(are|am|be|feel|felt) (value|belong|seen|heard|includ|understood)', ' bias'), [10, 10, 10, 15], -1]\\n[('(are|am|be|feel|felt) (value|belong|seen|heard|includ|understood)', 'work( conditions| environment|( )?place)', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\nunsafe conditions (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('work( )?place', 'work', 'harass', ' bias'), [10, 10, 10, 15], -1]\\n\\noccupational injury (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', ' race( |,|.)'), [7, 15], 0]\\n[('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', '(disab(i|l)| able-bod)'), [7, 15], 0]\\n[('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', 'religio'), [7, 15], 0]\\n[('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', 'gender'), [7, 15], 0]\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>bias (bias)  [harassment], \\n bias (bias)  [discrimination], \\n bias (bias)  [harassment-employee], \\n bias (bias)  [inclusive culture], \\n bias (bias)  [unsafe conditions], \\ngender (gender-M/F)  [occupational injury], \\nreligio (religio)  [occupational injury], \\n race( |,|.)

world: fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" and it’s true. many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. but that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. according to a ucla study published in 2016, misusing bmi as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. and yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like bmi and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nthere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. the same \"maintenance phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" and one more for good measure: “there is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for the american journal of managed care. to help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? they should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. as they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. and any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","

Several companies on the Fortune list are run by CEOs ranging from 71 to 91! Consider the age of the most powerful executives in the United States. President Biden was 78 when he became president. Donald Trump was 70. Barak Obama seems like a baby considering he entered the Oval Office when he was just 47.

seemingly completely objective and bias-free? The authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the MBTA at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. They identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules. Since women tend to have more inflexible commitments outside of work (such as elder care and childcare), they generally end up taking home less pay when shifts are scheduled last-minute, at non-standard hours, or via a system that doesn’t give workers control over their assignments. Moreover, the authors found that these scheduling practices ended up harming the MBTA’s performance metrics as well, leading to more canceled bus and train routes. To address these issues, the authors recommend that employers should endeavor to offer more-predictable schedules and build in redundancies so that workers aren’t asked to work last-minute or at unconventional times. Despite substantial progress toward pay equity, women in 2022 still earn 17% less than men on average. Many explanations for this gap have been proposed: Women may choose to work in lower-paying occupations; they may have less experience due to having taken time off to have kids or care for elders; they may shy away from negotiation or competition; they may be passed over by managers, perhaps due to conscious or unconscious bias.

                    Inclusivity should be a top priority for HR, but it can be hard to implement Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategies and turn them into real action to achieve true inclusivity. Keeping track of goals and assessing DEI throughout the year can help you stay on track and find out how inclusive your company really is.\\n\\nWhat is true inclusivity?\\nTrue inclusivity means going beyond an on-paper DEI strategy to actively implement inclusivity into your workplace, for people across all points of difference such as ability, race, gender and religion. True inclusivity goes beyond just HR initiatives, too – it needs to be a company-wide culture of openness and belonging for all.\\n\\nAlthough it may seem hard to achieve, inclusivity is an important part of DEI that can even help the business. Inclusivity can lead to more innovation and may be more likely to outperform competitors. This is because creating a culture of inclusivity makes all employees feel welcomed. It gives them a sense of belonging, which can not only increase meaningfulness at work but can make them feel more comfortable bringing ideas to the table. \\n\\nHow to create true inclusivity\\nWhen it comes to promoting equity and inclusion, there are three areas to focus on, says Aubrey Blanche, global head of equitable design and impact at Culture Amp. \\n\\nBlanche suggests focusing efforts on creating transparency in talent processes, intentionally prioritizing fairness and promoting access to development and recognition. This may look like: \\n\\nImplementing employee recognition programs\\nHaving formal mentorship and sponsorship programs\\nCreating clear career advancement processes, and\\nExplicitly sourcing underrepresented talent.\\nHow to track and assess inclusivity \\nConstantly assessing and keeping track of DEI goals can help you understand what you’re doing well and what still needs to be worked on to create true inclusivity. ...   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ... Japan\\nSo if workplace weight loss programs don’t actually improve employee health — what is it they are attempting to do?\\n\\nAs the writer and fat activist Aubrey Gordon put it when discussing workplace wellness programs on a recent episode of her podcast \"Maintenance Phase\": \"One of the major narratives that drives our understanding of and response to fat people in the world: Fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" And it’s true. Many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. But that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. According to a UCLA study published in 2016, misusing BMI as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat Americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. And yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like BMI and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nThere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. The same \"Maintenance Phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" Another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" And one more for good measure: “There is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for The American Journal of Managed Care. To help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: Are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? They should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. As they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. Office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. Hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. Health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. Weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. And any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...   \n","2  Layoffs Challenged Based on Gender\\n\\nSoon after Elon Musk bought Twitter, the company laid off about 3,700 employees—roughly half its workforce—and hundreds more then resigned. The new lawsuit said that Twitter laid off 57 percent of its female employees, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender disparity was greater for engineering roles, where 63 percent of women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n\"It's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when Elon Musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,\" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, the plaintiffs' lawyer, who is in Boston.\\n\\nTwitter has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit involving the alleged failure to provide advance notice and hasn't responded to other complaints.\\n\\n(The Guardian)\\n\\nOther Complaints\\n\\nOther complaints against Twitter claim it backed out of promises to allow remote work and provide consistent severance benefits after Musk bought the company, as well as complaints related to alleged disability- and gender-based discrimination and another lawsuit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off. At least one employee claimed that Twitter did not provide enough notice of the layoffs, allegedly violating federal and California laws, and did not offer additional pay in lieu of notice. Three claims also have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.\\n\\nTwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.\\n\\n(CNN)\\n\\nLayoffs Snowball\\n\\nTwitter isn't the only company that has laid off workers. The technology sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands laid off, including from Meta and Stripe. Sales and recruiting jobs have sustained some of the deepest cuts. In addition, layoffs have spread beyond technology, such as to the Walt Disney Co.\\n\\n(SHRM Online and Fast Company)\\n\\nLayoffs Are Harming DE&I Efforts\\n\\nRecent layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, have eroded diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts nationwide. The tech industry already is one of the least diverse. In 2021, just 4.4 percent of employees at Google were Black and 6.4 percent were Latino, according to the company's diversity report. At Meta, people with disabilities represented about 6 percent of the company's workforce, despite accounting for 19 percent of the U.S. labor force.\\n\\n(SHRM Online)\\n\\nHow to Conduct Layoffs the Right Way\\n\\nIn addition to abiding by employment laws regarding layoffs, communication and accurate information are two of the most essential elements to conducting layoffs well. It's important to ensure everyone is aware of what's happening and what their options are.\\n\\n\"Folks impacted by job loss have so many questions, are often fraught with fear and trepidation of what's next, and they need and deserve support,\" said Barbie Winterbottom, CHRO, founder and CEO of the Business of HR in Tampa, Fla. \"At the same time, HR teams can be overwhelmed with phone calls and e-mails from hundreds or thousands of employees while trying to process required documents and manage required steps in systems. It can make timely communication tough.\"\\n\\n(SHRM Online)   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, is a popular yet sensitive topic in the workforce today. Leadership and HR that recognize this are finding ways to ensure employees from all races, ethnicities, abilities, sexual orientations, religions, etc., are represented. Sometimes included, but often left out, is age.\\n\\nAge shows no color, race, religion, sex, etc. It just is. People get older, and as they do, workplace biases may become evident. It’s important to be aware of this issue. A 2022 study by LiveCareer, Older People & the Workplace, revealed some intriguing findings regarding age-related stereotypes and discrimination. More than 1,000 workers were surveyed to “investigate their opinions about older people in the workplace.”\\n\\nEight in ten respondents claimed age stereotypes were still alive in the workplace.\\nWhat is considered old? Forty-three percent of those surveyed said 40-plus is old. Twenty-six percent said 50-plus is old. And 21% said 60-plus is old. So, if you are 50, with probably 15 or more years until retirement, 69% of the people you work with think you are old. Here are some more findings from LiveCareer’s study to get you thinking about how your organization treats aging employees:\\n\\n· 74% of the respondents aged 50-plus said they had been fired because of their age.\\n\\n\\n· 86% aged 50-plus felt that most job postings were addressed to people younger than them.\\n\\n· 72% of respondents claimed that older employees were a target for workplace bullying. · 77% of the respondents said: I haven’t been hired for a job because of my age.\\n\\n· 69% said: I’m afraid to lose my job because of my age.\\n\\nIf over 50 is old, then leadership is … old. According to Zippia, there are over 38,700 CEOs currently employed in the U.S., and their average age is 52 years old. If you look at the Fortune 500, the average age of a CEO is 57. Several companies on the Fortune list are run by CEOs ranging from 71 to 91! Consider the age of the most powerful executives in the United States. President Biden was 78 when he became president. Donald Trump was 70. Barak Obama seems like a baby considering he entered the Oval Office when he was just 47. The overall average age of a United States president entering office is 56 (almost 57).\\n...   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Summary.   \\nMany factors contribute to a substantial gender pay gap in the U.S. But what about environments in which compensation structures are seemingly completely objective and bias-free? The authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the MBTA at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. They identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules. Since women tend to have more inflexible commitments outside of work (such as elder care and childcare), they generally end up taking home less pay when shifts are scheduled last-minute, at non-standard hours, or via a system that doesn’t give workers control over their assignments. Moreover, the authors found that these scheduling practices ended up harming the MBTA’s performance metrics as well, leading to more canceled bus and train routes. To address these issues, the authors recommend that employers should endeavor to offer more-predictable schedules and build in redundancies so that workers aren’t asked to work last-minute or at unconventional times. Despite substantial progress toward pay equity, women in 2022 still earn 17% less than men on average. Many explanations for this gap have been proposed: Women may choose to work in lower-paying occupations; they may have less experience due to having taken time off to have kids or care for elders; they may shy away from negotiation or competition; they may be passed over by managers, perhaps due to conscious or unconscious bias. But what would happen to the earnings gap if we eliminated all of these factors?...   \n","\n","

priority for hr, but it can be hard to implement diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) strategies and turn them into real action to achieve true inclusivity. keeping track of goals and assessing dei throughout the year can help you stay on track and find out how inclusive your company really is.\\n\\nwhat is true inclusivity?\\ntrue inclusivity means going beyond an on-paper dei strategy to actively implement inclusivity into your workplace, for people across all points of difference such as ability, race, gender and religion. true inclusivity goes beyond just hr initiatives, too – it needs to be a company-wide culture of openness and belonging for all.\\n\\nalthough it may seem hard to achieve, inclusivity is an important part of dei that can even help the business. inclusivity can lead to more innovation and may be more likely to outperform competitors. this is because creating a culture of inclusivity makes all employees feel welcomed. it gives them a sense of belonging, which can not only increase meaningfulness at work but can make them feel more comfortable bringing ideas to the table. \\n\\nhow to create true inclusivity\\nwhen it comes to promoting equity and inclusion, there are three areas to focus on, says aubrey blanche, global head of equitable design and impact at culture amp. \\n\\nblanche suggests focusing efforts on creating transparency in talent processes, intentionally prioritizing fairness and promoting access to development and recognition. this may look like: \\n\\nimplementing employee recognition programs\\nhaving formal mentorship and sponsorship programs\\ncreating clear career advancement processes, and\\nexplicitly sourcing underrepresented talent.\\nhow to track and assess inclusivity \\nconstantly assessing and keeping track of dei goals can help you understand what you’re doing well and what still needs to be worked on to create true inclusivity. ...   \n","1

actually improve employee health — what is it they are attempting to do?\\n\\nas the writer and fat activist aubrey gordon put it when discussing workplace wellness programs on a recent episode of her podcast \"maintenance phase\": \"one of the major narratives that drives our understanding of and response to fat people in the world: fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" and it’s true. many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. but that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. according to a ucla study published in 2016, misusing bmi as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. and yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like bmi and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nthere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. the same \"maintenance phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" and one more for good measure: “there is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for the american journal of managed care. to help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? they should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. as they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. and any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...   \n","2  twitter’s layoffs allegedly

women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n\"it's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when elon musk was

evident. it’s important to be aware of this issue. a 2022 study by livecareer, older people & the workplace, revealed some intriguing findings regarding age-related stereotypes and discrimination. more than 1,000 workers were surveyed to “investigate their opinions about older people in the workplace.”\\n\\neight in ten respondents claimed age stereotypes were still alive in the workplace.\\nwhat is considered old? forty-three percent of those surveyed said 40-plus is old. twenty-six percent said 50-plus is old. and 21% said 60-plus is old. so, if you are 50, with probably 15

what about environments in which compensation structures are seemingly completely objective and bias-free? the authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the mbta at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. they identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules. since women tend to have more inflexible commitments outside of work (such as elder care and childcare), they generally end up taking home less pay when shifts are scheduled last-minute, at non-standard hours, or via a system that doesn’t give workers control over their assignments. moreover, the authors found that these scheduling practices ended up harming the mbta’s performance metrics as well, leading to more canceled bus and train routes. to address these issues, the authors recommend that employers should endeavor to offer more-predictable schedules and build in redundancies so that workers aren’t asked to work last-minute or at unconventional times. despite substantial progress toward pay equity, women in 2022 still earn 17% less than men on average. many explanations for this gap have been proposed: women may choose to work in lower-paying occupations; they may have less experience due to having taken time off to have kids or care for elders; they may shy away from negotiation or competition; they may be passed over by managers, perhaps due to conscious or unconscious bias. but what would happen to the earnings gap if we eliminated all of these factors?...   \n","\n","   ANY_RRP_TOPIC  ANY_WVP_TOPIC  ANY_DEISG_TOPIC  ANY_MBOD_TOPIC  \\\n","0              0

Japan\\nSo if workplace weight loss programs don’t actually improve employee health — what is it they are attempting to do?\\n\\nAs the writer and fat activist Aubrey Gordon put it when discussing workplace wellness programs on a recent episode of her podcast \"Maintenance Phase\": \"One of the major narratives that drives our understanding of and response to fat people in the world: Fat people are most frequently discussed as a cost.\" And it’s true. Many of the underlying arguments for these kinds of discriminatory programs are in the name of saving health care costs. But that argument starts to fall apart quickly when you consider that fat is not a reliable indicator of health. According to a UCLA study published in 2016, misusing BMI as a measure of health incorrectly labels millions of fat Americans as unhealthy, even though by other measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, they are not. And yet, workplace wellness programs that focus on weight loss and other fatphobic-related measures like BMI and fat percentage persist. \\n\\nThere’s not much evidence to suggest these workplace weight loss programs even reduce costs. The same \"Maintenance Phase\" episode pointed out a 2013 study, which found that \"savings to employers may come from cost shifting, with the most vulnerable employees — those from lower socioeconomic strata with the most health risks — probably bearing greater costs that in effect subsidize their healthier colleagues.\" Another study in 2021 makes the point that \"if the goal is to save money by reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism or to improve chronic physical health conditions, there is little evidence that this type of program delivers the desired results.\" And one more for good measure: “There is no evidence that these programs work, but ample evidence exists that they are a morale-reducing and expensive distraction from the business of business,” according to medical experts in a 2015 article for The American Journal of Managed Care. To help make this the rule rather than the exception, employers should be asking themselves: Are larger employees welcome and safe in their workplace? They should remind staff to never comment on people’s bodies, as you would on race, religion, gender or sexuality. As they might accommodate someone with an injury or disability, workplaces should ensure that office space and travel needs accommodate plus-size employees. Office gifts and swag should be kept body neutral or offered in extended sizes for folks who need it. Hiring practices should be updated to recognize and combat anti-fat bias like all other implicit biases. Health care plans should offer a wide range of providers so fat folks can see the best medical professionals for them. Weight discrimination and anti-fat bias could be included in workplace harassment training. And any workplace wellness program that specifically incentivizes weight loss should be acknowledged as harmful and ended immediately. \\n...</td>\n","      <td>https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/leave-2023-weight-loss-talk-out-of-work-fat-employers-dei-rcna64069</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>training-bias/anti-harassment/non-discrimination (Worker-Voice/Protection): [(' train', '(anti|non)?( |-)bias', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\ncombat bias (General-Practice): [('combat', ' bias', ' bias'), [6, 15], 0]\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>harassment (DEI-Strategy/Governance): [('harass', 'harass', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\ndiscrimination (DEI-Strategy/Governance): [(' discriminat', ' discriminat', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\nharassment-employee (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('harass', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', ' bias'), [10, 15], -1]\\n\\ninclusive culture (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('work( )?place', 'work', '(are|am|be|feel|felt) (value|belong|seen|heard|includ|understood)', ' bias'), [10, 10, 10, 15], -1]\\n[('(are|am|be|feel|felt) (value|belong|seen|heard|includ|understood)', 'work( conditions| environment|( )?place)', ' bias'), [7, 15], -1]\\n\\nunsafe conditions (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('work( )?place', 'work', 'harass', ' bias'), [10, 10, 10, 15], -1]\\n\\noccupational injury (Worker-Voice/Protection): [('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', ' race( |,|.)'), [7, 15], 0]\\n[('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', '(disab(i|l)| able-bod)'), [7, 15], 0]\\n[('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', 'religio'), [7, 15], 0]\\n[('injur(e|ies|y)', 'work(er|force|( )?place)', 'gender'), [7, 15], 0]\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>bias (bias)  [harassment], \\n bias (bias)  [discrimination], \\n bias (bias)  [harassment-employee], \\n bias (bias)  [inclusive culture], \\n bias (bias)  [unsafe conditions], \\ngender (gender-M/F)  [occupational injury], \\nreligio (religio)  [occupational injury], \\n race( |,|.)

Elon Musk bought Twitter, the company laid off about 3,700 employees—roughly half its workforce—and hundreds more then resigned. The new lawsuit said that Twitter laid off 57 percent of its female employees, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender disparity was greater for engineering roles, where 63 percent of women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n\"It's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when Elon Musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,\" said Shannon Liss-Riordan, the plaintiffs' lawyer, who is in Boston.\\n\\nTwitter has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit involving the alleged failure to provide advance notice and hasn't responded to other complaints.\\n\\n(The Guardian)\\n\\nOther Complaints\\n\\nOther complaints against Twitter claim it backed out of promises to allow remote work and provide consistent severance benefits after Musk bought the company, as well as complaints related to alleged disability- and gender-based discrimination and another lawsuit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off. At least one employee claimed that Twitter did not provide enough notice of the layoffs, allegedly violating federal and California laws, and did not offer additional pay in lieu of notice. Three claims also have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.\\n\\nTwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.\\n\\n(CNN)\\n\\nLayoffs Snowball\\n\\nTwitter isn't the only company that has laid off workers. The technology sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands laid off, including from Meta and Stripe. Sales and recruiting jobs have sustained some of the deepest cuts. In addition, layoffs have spread beyond technology, such as to the Walt Disney Co.\\n\\n(SHRM Online and Fast Company)\\n\\nLayoffs Are Harming DE&amp;I Efforts\\n\\nRecent layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, have eroded diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) efforts nationwide. The tech industry already is one of the least diverse. In 2021, just 4.4 percent of employees at Google were Black and 6.4 percent were Latino, according to the company's diversity report. At Meta, people with disabilities represented about 6 percent of the company's workforce, despite accounting for 19 percent of the U.S. labor force.\\n\\n(SHRM Online)\\n\\nHow to Conduct Layoffs the Right Way\\n\\nIn addition to abiding by employment laws regarding layoffs, communication and accurate information are two of the most essential elements to conducting layoffs well. It's important to ensure everyone is aware of what's happening and what their options are.\\n\\n\"Folks impacted by job loss have so many questions, are often fraught with fear and trepidation of what's next, and they need and deserve support,\" said Barbie Winterbottom, CHRO, founder and CEO of the Business of HR in Tampa, Fla. \"At the same time, HR teams can be overwhelmed with phone calls and e-mails from hundreds or thousands of employees while trying to process required documents and manage required steps in systems. It can make timely communication tough.\"\\n\\n(SHRM Online)</td>\n","

allegedly discriminated against women layoffs challenged based on gender\\n\\nsoon after elon musk bought twitter, the company laid off about 3,700 employees—roughly half its workforce—and hundreds more then resigned. the new lawsuit said that twitter laid off 57 percent of its female employees, compared with 47 percent of men. the gender disparity was greater for engineering roles, where 63 percent of women lost their jobs, compared to 48 percent of men, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\n\"it's not a huge surprise, unfortunately, that women were hit so hard by these layoffs when elon musk was overseeing these incredibly ad hoc layoffs just in a matter of days,\" said shannon liss-riordan, the plaintiffs' lawyer, who is in boston.\\n\\ntwitter has denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit involving the alleged failure to provide advance notice and hasn't responded to other complaints.\\n\\n(the guardian)\\n\\nother complaints\\n\\nother complaints against twitter claim it backed out of promises to allow remote work and provide consistent severance benefits after musk bought the company, as well as complaints related to alleged disability- and gender-based discrimination and another lawsuit on behalf of twitter contractors who were laid off. at least one employee claimed that twitter did not provide enough notice of the layoffs, allegedly violating federal and california laws, and did not offer additional pay in lieu of notice. three claims also have been filed with the national labor relations board on behalf of former employees.\\n\\ntwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits.\\n\\n(cnn)\\n\\nlayoffs snowball\\n\\ntwitter isn't the only company that has laid off workers. the technology sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands laid off, including from meta and stripe. sales and recruiting jobs have sustained some of the deepest cuts. in addition, layoffs have spread beyond technology, such as to the walt disney co.\\n\\n(shrm online and fast company)\\n\\nlayoffs are harming de&amp;i efforts\\n\\nrecent layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, have eroded diversity, equity and inclusion (de&amp;i) efforts nationwide. the tech industry already is one of the least diverse. in 2021, just 4.4 percent of employees at google were black and 6.4 percent were latino, according to the company's diversity report. at meta, people with disabilities represented about 6 percent of the company's workforce, despite accounting for 19 percent of the u.s. labor force.\\n\\n(shrm online)\\n\\nhow to conduct layoffs the right way\\n\\nin addition to abiding by employment laws regarding layoffs, communication and accurate information are two of the most essential elements to conducting layoffs well. it's important to ensure everyone is aware of what's happening and what their options are.\\n\\n\"folks impacted by job loss have so many questions, are often fraught with fear and trepidation of what's next, and they need and deserve support,\" said barbie winterbottom, chro, founder and ceo of the business of hr in tampa, fla. \"at the same time, hr teams can be overwhelmed with phone calls and e-mails from hundreds or thousands of employees while trying to process required documents and manage required steps in systems. it can make timely communication tough.\"\\n\\n(shrm online)</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","

Forty-three percent of those surveyed said 40-plus is old. Twenty-six percent said 50-plus is old. And 21% said 60-plus is old.

Several companies on the Fortune list are run by CEOs ranging from 71 to 91! Consider the age of the most powerful executives in the United States. President Biden was 78 when he became president. Donald Trump was 70. Barak Obama seems like a baby considering he entered the Oval Office when he was just 47.

what about environments in which compensation structures are seemingly completely objective and bias-free? The authors analyzed seven years of pay data for bus and train operators employed by the MBTA at union-negotiated rates and found that even among people in exactly the same role at the same seniority level, women still took home 11% less than men. They identified three factors driving this persistent earnings gap: unpredictable, unconventional, and uncontrollable schedules. Since women tend to have more inflexible commitments outside of work (such as elder care and childcare), they generally end up taking home less pay when shifts are scheduled last-minute, at non-standard hours, or via a system that doesn’t give workers control over their assignments. Moreover, the authors found that these scheduling practices ended up harming the MBTA’s performance metrics as well, leading to more canceled bus and train routes. To address these issues, the authors recommend that employers should endeavor to offer more-predictable schedules and build in redundancies so that workers aren’t asked to work last-minute or at unconventional times. Despite substantial progress toward pay equity, women in 2022 still earn 17% less than men on average. Many explanations for this gap have been proposed: Women may choose to work in lower-paying occupations; they may have less experience due to having taken time off to have kids or care for elders; they may shy away from negotiation or competition; they may be passed over by managers, perhaps due to conscious or unconscious bias.
